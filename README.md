# Deni-Team-Profile-Generator-wk10

## Description

This task was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a fictious software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Unit testing was used for all employee types.

## Installation

This program is not publicly deployed, so it will need the following:

  1. Node.js
  2. Uses the Inquirer package.
  3. Uses the Jest package for a suite of unit tests.
